							<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I grew up around tech, as my dad has consulted in IT security for nearly 30 years, and my academic interests always gravitated toward math and science. Accordingly, I was on the pre-med track at Pepperdine University, where I graduated with a B.S. in Biology. Following graduation, I had everything in order for med school admissions; however, despite my interest in medicine as a field of study, I found myself becoming increasingly disinterest in pursuing it as a career.</br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Around the same time my interest in tech peaked. I became fascinated with Bitcoin and Blockchain technology, and the first code I ever wrote was for crypto-currency miners. While I could not yet appreciate what these elegant lines of code were doing, it was satisfying to engage in this captivating world a little more fully. I began dreaming about a career as a programmer and concurrently regretting my college major. I moved on and had several diversified employment experiences over the next few years.  on several di deviated from this dream and held several diverse roles over the past few years; however, I quickly rose to the top of all of them, despite their unrelatedness and I identified a few key qualities in myself that consistently showed through within each new role I took on, Foremost, I am an extremely quick learner, with a aptness for teaching a newly acquired skill to others. I am a instinctive problem solver with a high capacity for critical thinking. And I have a refined creativity, which, although it is ancillary to my logical disposition, it has consistently distinguished me from my equally intelligent peers.</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I learned a lot from varied experiences, I became restless just working for a paycheck and knew I ultimately wanted a career that I was passionate about. I made a resolution this year to find my vocation, and within a few days I saw an ad for App Academy’s program. I saw this as a singular opportunity to get my foot in the door in the tech industry and quickly applied. While this four-week program was simply an introductory prep-course meant to lead into other boot camps, it revealed to me that -- in addition to my existing impression that programming could be an exciting profession that might fit well in my life -- I am a great fit as a programmer and have a natural aptitude for this line of work. One completion of the course, I knew for certain this was the path for me, the following day I enrolled in Thinkful’s full-stack web development program.</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next four months flew by, and I cannot believe how much I’ve learned in such a short period. The first couple months I was just trying to soak in all of this new information, and then right around the halfway mark everything seemed to click. After week eight we had a break week, and my ‘break’ was spent coding around the clock -- I built three full-stack apps before class resumed the following Monday. From that point forward, I was coding about 12 hours every day and always had at least one side project I was working on. I became increasingly fulfilled by my work and began to experience firsthand the old adage, “Do what you love and you’ll never work a day in your life.</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I distinctly remember the moment at which I felt like my competency could facilitate programming as a profession. During week thirteen, against the advice of a couple advisors who thought it would be out of the scope of the five day project, I build a full-stack backgammon  game independently, and had a functional version deployed in time for presentations. Also, I made the frontend with React, but wrote the backend in Python, which I had never used before that week. I clearly remember feeling more focused and comfortable coding than ever that week, and feeling extremely accomplished as a saw how significantly my ability and level of understanding had increased from just the week prior.</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining three weeks were spent on one, final capstone project. I was assigned to a group of four and came into that week full of ideas for the project. We decided as a group to build one of my proposals, a project we called “Code Up”. I took the lead on the project, serving as the project manager. Throughout the last three weeks of the course, I spent significantly less time coding than I had in previous weeks, because I encouraged my teammates to take the lead on aspects of the project they weren’t as comfortable with and then assumed more of a mentor role, pairing off alternately with each of them to increase their competency in these areas. Because I took a step back from programming, it was a great exercise in taking on a leadership role and passing on the sound understanding of the material I had developed to my peers. Also, I recognized that one of my strengths as a programmer is the ability to clearly visualize the big picture of an app from early on, and understand how it will all connect together, even before deciphering what the individual pieces will look like exactly on a closer level. This quality served me well as I was able to oversee my partner's’ individual code and constantly make sure it was on track to fit into the larger scheme. While I would have liked to have spent a little more on UI/UX, I was incredibly proud in what we were able to accomplish in those three weeks, as this project was far more complex than anything we’d done previously, with extensive features and delicate socket handling.</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In sum, despite the relatively short timeline of my coding career, I believe that my academic background in the hard-sciences and my other life experiences have been preparing me for this career for some time -- laying out the groundwork on which I was able to quickly develop a formidable generalist programming ability. I absolutely love coding, and it has truly become the primary focus of my time and energy in just a few short months. I am ecstatic about starting a career as a software engineer and further expanding my programming ability.</p>
